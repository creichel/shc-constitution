## Purpose

The student dorm is a place where not only students live, but students from different countries and universities learn, meet and exchange. Based on the political influence of our anchestors and the cooperation with the Studierendenwerk, we are able to use rooms like a shared Bar, tea room and plenty of creative and other workshop rooms for free unless we are taking care of these. Besides, we are free to do events of different kinds and organize us in the way we think is suitable to establish and save the care for everything we have got the rights for. For this, the tenants of the student dormitory are electing the student council to have a legit key for the management and establishment of these rights.

**The purpose of the student council is thus to take key decisions and actions to manage and make use of the legit rights in the purpose of all current and future tenants in mind.**
